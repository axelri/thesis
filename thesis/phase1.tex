\subsubsection{Phase 1}
\label{subsub:phaseone}
In this phase we transform every $q_i \in Q$ to sequences of game blocks. These sequences will be part of the block states $P_1, \ldots P_n$ in the constructed \textit{k-cleared-cells} instance. The transformation is done by creating a sequence of 1 $\mathbf{H}_{H}$, $q_i$ $\mathbf{H}$ and 1 $\mathbf{H}_H$ blocks (in their initial state) for each give $q_i$.

When placing the first block it is evident that we have only two choices: place the $\mathbf{H}_H$ block column 2-3 of any well. This transform the chosen well from a closed to an open state. We then proceed to placing the middle $q_i$ blocks. When deciding the outcome of these placements the following lemmas are of use:\\


\begin{lem}
\label{lem:permclose}
In phase 1, placing a $\mathbf{H}$ block in any other column than 4-5 in a well will make the same well permanently closed.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
In the first case, the well is closed. We can only place the $\mathbf{H}$ block in column 2-3. Since no cells are cleared as a result, column 1 to 4 are filled except for the top two rows. We therefore cannot place any block in these columns without a game over. Either the column right of column 5 is filled, or the gameboard has ended. Since column 4 is also filled, we cannot place any block in column 5. Thus the well is permanently closed.

In the second case, the well is open. Apart from column 4-5, the $\mathbf{H}$ block can only be placed in column 3-4. This does not clear any cells as a result. Thus with the same arguments as in the first case, the well is permanently closed.
\end{proof}

\bigbreak

\begin{lem}
In phase 1, for each well: Column 1 is unchanged. Column 2-4 will always be filled below row $2 \left( \sum Q + K + 1 \right) - 3$. Column 5 is always empty as long as the well is not blocked.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
The following facts hold for each column:

Column 1 can not be cleared because alternating rows to the top \textbf{todo prove, maybe show somewhere else}

Column 2 is initially filled below row $2 \left( \sum Q + K + 1 \right) - 3$ with alternating rows and forms a checkered terrain with column 3 in the interval $\left[ 2 \left( K - 1 \right) + 1, 2 \left( \sum Q + K + 1 \right) - 3 \right]$. Because column 2 has alternating rows there is no way to clear rows from anywhere except the top of the column. It is known that column 1 can not be cleared which leaves two requirements to clear any of the cells claimed to always be filled in column 2: Column 3 must leave place for a white cell at $2 \left( \sum Q + K + 1 \right) - 4$ and a fitting piece must be dropped to create a white $2 \times 2$ block. Both of these requirements are unfulfilled but we will only prove the first requirement.

Column 3 is initially filled below $2 \left( \sum Q + K + 1 \right) - 3$. The interval $\left[ 2 \left( K - 1 \right) + 1, 2 \left( \sum Q + K + 1 \right) - 3 \right]$ consists of alternating rows. Beneath $2 \left( K - 1 \right) + 1$ the column is filled with white cells. In a closed well rows in column 3 can only be cleared if column 2 leaves place 
\end{proof}

Since later in the proof it will become apparent that having a permanently closed well makes it impossible to construct a optimal trajectory sequence, lemma~\ref{lem:permclose} leaves us no choice but to place all $\mathbf{H}$ blocks in column 4-5 of the open well. Finally the last $\mathbf{H}_H$ block must be placed either in column 2-3 of a closed well, or column 3-4 of an open well, in order to not permanently close a well.

Assuming that no blocks has been place such that any well is permanently closed, the following invariants holds at the start of the sequence corresponding to $q_i$:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Either both of the wells are closed, or both of the wells are open.

\item Column 1, 3 and 5 in any well are unchanged from the initial gameboard. Column 2 is unchanged except from the top two rows (which may be black or empty).

\item Let $q_0 = 0$. This does not change the semantics of the givet \textit{Subset sum} instance. Then in total 
\begin{equation*}
    2 \left( i-1 \right) + \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} q_j
\end{equation*}
blocks have been placed.

\item Since each block placement clears exactly 4 cells
\begin{equation*}
    8 \left( i-1 \right) + 4 \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} q_j
\end{equation*}
cells have been cleared.

\item There exists: 
    \begin{equation*}
        M_1, M_2 \subseteq \{q_0, \ldots q_{i-1}\}, M_1 \cap M_2 = \varnothing, M_1 \cup M_2 = \{q_0, \ldots, q_{i-1}\}
    \end{equation*}
such that for any well $w \in \{1,2\}$ it holds that the rows in interval
    \begin{equation*}
        \left[ 2 \left( K-1 + \sum Q - \sum M_w \right) +1, 2 \left( K-1 + \sum Q \right) \right]
    \end{equation*}
consists of white cells in column 4, and the rows in interval
    \begin{equation*}
        \left[ 1, 2 \left( K-1 + \sum Q - \sum M_w \right) \right]
    \end{equation*}
consists of black cells in column 4.
\end{enumerate}

When every block sequence corresponding to the elements of $Q$ has been placed, $a$ elements has been transformed. For all purposes of this proof this is equivalent to being at the start of the sequence corresponding to $q_{a+1}$, even though strictly speaking no such element is given. Thus $i = a+1$ and from the invariants we obtain:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Still holds.
\item Still holds.
\item In total
\begin{equation*}
    2a + \sum Q
\end{equation*}
blocks have been placed.

\item In total
\begin{equation*}
    8a + 4 \sum Q
\end{equation*}
cells have been cleared.

\item There exists:
\begin{equation*}
    M_1, M_2 \subseteq Q, M_1 \cap M_2 = \varnothing, M_1 \cup M_2 = Q
\end{equation*}
such that for any well $w \in \{1,2\}$ it holds that the rows in interval
\begin{equation*}
        \left[ 2 \left( K-1 + \sum Q - \sum M_w \right) +1, 2 \left( K-1 + \sum Q \right) \right]

    \end{equation*}
