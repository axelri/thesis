\subsection{Conclusion}

Since a complete reduction from \textit{Subset sum} to \textit{k-cleared-cells} was presented in~\ref{sub:nphard}, the following theorem is proven:

\begin{thm}
\label{thm:nphard}
The (offline, no-rotation, acyclic) k-cleared-cells problem is NP-hard.
\end{thm}

Corollary~\ref{cor:np} and theorem~\ref{thm:nphard} directly yields the following corollary: \\

\begin{cor}
The (offline, no-rotation, acyclic) k-cleared-cells problem is NP-complete.
\end{cor}
