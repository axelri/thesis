\subsubsection{Phase 4}
If the blocks has been placed as desjcribed in the previous phases, any block can only be placed in column 4-5 of the open well without trigger a game over. A sequence of $\sum Q - 1$ $\mathbf{LB}$ blocks are generated. Placing these blocks in column 4-5 of the open well will collapse column 4 making room for another placement, just like a $\mathbf{H}$ block did in the previous phases. Since no other terrain is cleared as a result of this placement, we are forced to continue placing the $\mathbf{LB}$ blocks in the same manner.

When placing block $\sum Q - \sum M_w + 1$ the well open $w$ thus has the properties depicted in~\autoref{fig:beforecol}.
