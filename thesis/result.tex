\subsection{On the size of the problem input}
The input to a particular instance of the k-cleared-cells problem is the game $G = (B_0, P_1, \ldots, P_p)$. In order to analyze the verifiability of a given solution in polynomial time, we must begin by examining the size $|G|$. The game contains on gameboard $B_0$ of size $|B| = mn$, and $p$ block states which are all of constant size. Hence of the size of all the blocks state are $O(p)$. Thus $|G| \in O(p \cdot |B|)$.

\subsection{On the size of the problem solution}
The solution to a particular instance of the k-cleared-cells problem is the trajectory sequence $\phi=(B_0, \tau_1, B_1, \ldots ,\tau_p, B_p)$. Since definition~\ref{defn:checkable} depends both on the size of $|G|$ and $|\phi|$, examining the size of $|\phi|$ is of importance. $\phi$ consists of $p$ gameboards of size $|B| = mn$, and $p$ trajectories of unknown but finite size. We therefore define $C$ to be the upper bound of the amounts of operations in any trajectory in $\phi$. Thus $|\phi| \in O(p \cdot |B| \cdot C)$.
