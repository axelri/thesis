\subsection{Is k-cleared-cells NP-hard?}
\label{sub:nphard}

\textit{K-cleared-cells is NP-hard} is proven to be NP-hard by constructing a reduction from the \textit{Subset sum} problem. The reduction consists of two parts: one part which considers $K > 1$ in the given \textit{Subset sum} instance, and one part which considers the special case $K = 1$. The first part is quite complex and consists of five phases, whereas the second part is relatively straightforward.

The goal of each part is to prove the following: 

\begin{quote}
Given a \textit{Subset sum} instance $Q = \{q_1, \ldots, q_a\}, K \in \mathbb{N}$ there exists a solution $S = \{s_1, \ldots, s_b \} \subseteq Q, \sum S = K$ if and only if there exists a trajectory sequence $\phi$ which clears at least $k$ cells in game $G$ in some instance of \textit{k-cleared-cells}.
\end{quote}

For the general case $K > 1$, we set $k = 8a + 5 \sum Q + 4 + 4K$. For the special case $K = 1$, we set $k = 4$. The block states $P_i$ in $\mathcal{G}$ are determined from $Q$ and $K$. This transformation is described in detail in later sections.
