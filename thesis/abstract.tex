Lumines is a puzzle game where the player organizes dichromatic $2 \times 2$ blocks on a rectangular grid by rotating and moving them around the gameboard. A line sweeps the gameboard and clears all $2 \times 2$ monochromatic blocks that the player has formed. This report examine the complexity of offline Lumines with two significant simplifications: instant clearing of blocks instead of using the sweep-line and no rotations. A decision problem is formulated for the model and shown to be in NP. The NP-complete subset sum problem is then reduced to the decision problem, thereby proving that the Lumines model is in fact NP-complete.
